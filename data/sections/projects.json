Nowadays, the increase of computational capabilities along with the continues decline of the sequencing costs have given us the opportunity of generating massive information on various structural and functional aspects of the human genome. Although, harnessing this information poses a real challenge, it holds the key for the development of therapeutics and targeted disease treatments that could be applied at individual level by taking into consideration our genetic idiosyncrasies. The collection, processing, analysis and integration of such information with other omic data consist the main aspects of this project.<br><br>Status: <span style='color:#EC7063'><b>Ongoing project</b></span>",
